# Airline Palindrome Project
The Palindrome Project is a Java program designed to create
a simulated airline account. It allows users to create their passenger accounts by providing their name, birthdate, password, and a PIN.
The entered account information is then stored for future access.
Input: The user interacts with the program by providing their name, birthdate, password, and PIN during the account
creation process. The user is also prompted to enter a string to check for palindrome status.
Output: The program displays a welcome message and clear instructions for the user to follow.
It also provides feedback to the user throughout the process, indicating whether their password is a
palindrome or not.
